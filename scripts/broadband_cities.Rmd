# Berlin, Lagos, Budapest: How fast is your internet?

Working from home is the new normal for millions of people worldwide. Yet, data shows that 6 in 10 users do not have internet connections fast enough for smooth telework. Has the pandemic deepened the digital divide? 

*In this repository, you will find the methodology, data and code behind the story that came out of this analysis.*

# Data sources

## Internet speed test data

This analysis uses data from [M-Lab](https://www.measurementlab.net/), an open source project which collects and provides data on internet speeds around the world. We use the results of their off-network measurements (NDT tests). The data is crowdsources, updated continuously and made freely available to the public. You can get more information about their datasets as well as a guide on how to get started in working with it yourself on their [website](https://www.measurementlab.net/data/.

- For data on median values per city, we used their [Dashboard](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/12XddYj7__cZOaBF2RwplImw_ZdQQ5Nuw/page/9GTNB )
- For a list of all measurements from Budapest, Berlin and Lagos, which we examine more closely, we used their BigQuery SQL interface. See query [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=754187384106:940cba401ad44bbf89eec11745789388)
- We also used BigQuery to calculate how many total measurements since 2019 have registered a download speed of at least 25 mbps. You can see that query [here](

)

## Geodata

- UN Statistics Division: [Standard country or area codes for statistical use (M49)](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/): country codes and corresponding regions and continents
- UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs: [The World's Cities in 2018 Data Booklet](https://www.un.org/en/events/citiesday/assets/pdf/the_worlds_cities_in_2018_data_booklet.pdf): population of cities with at least 1 million inhabitants

## 0. Read data

For median values per city: Only include cities with at least 2500 data points.

List of datasets used:

- `d`  Median speeds for cities since 2020-01-01, extracted from the dashboard. Only cities with >= 2500 data points included. Merged with continent and region information, as well as population data for cities with more than 1 million inhabitants in 2018
- `d_cities` All data points since 2019-01-01 for Berlin, Budapest and Lagos



```{r}
ggplot(d, aes(mbps, n)) + geom_point()
```
When cities have fewer than approx. 500,000 data points, download speeds vary more.
